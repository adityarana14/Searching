EASY QUESTIONS:

Q1) There are n tree in a forest. Heights of the trees is stored in array tree[ ]. If ith tree is cut at height h, the wood obtained is tree[i]-h, given that           tree[i]>h. If total wood needed is k (not less, neither more) find the height at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height).

Q2)  Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements. The task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element X in the given array.
     Note: If the element is not present in the array return {-1,-1} as pair.
