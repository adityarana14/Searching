EASY QUESTIONS:

Q1)  There are n tree in a forest. Heights of the trees is stored in array tree[ ]. If ith tree is cut at height h, the wood obtained is tree[i]-h, given that            tree[i]>h. If total wood needed is k (not less, neither more) find the height at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height).

Q2)  Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements. The task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element X in the given array.
     Note: If the element is not present in the array return {-1,-1} as pair. 

Q3)  Given an array Arr of N elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
     Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the maximum value.

Q4)  Given two arrays A and B contains integers of size N and M, the task is to find numbers which are present in the first array, but not present in the second          array.

Q5)  Dilpreet wants to paint his dog's home that has n boards with different lengths. The length of ith board is given by arr[i] where arr[] is an array of n            integers. He hired k painters for this work and each painter takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of the board. The problem is to find the minimum time to get          this job done if all painters start together with the constraint that any painter will only paint continuous boards, say boards numbered {2,3,4} or only board      {1} or nothing but not boards {2,4,5}.
